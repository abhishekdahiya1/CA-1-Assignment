# INTRODUCTION
The actual purpose of this study is to delvelop a cloud strategy for an organizational infrastructure. For conducting this study successfully , Zoho is choosen , which is a company that creates updated software for solving different types of problems that occcur in a business operation.
# Background of the organization
Zoho is an Indian technology organization that creates web-based tools for business and also different types of computer softaware. According to the leaders of the organization ,Zoho creates software to solve theri various business-relevant issues (Babu and Prasad 2021). They believe that software is he ultimate item of the hands and the minds. In spite of sales and marketing , the main motto behind the creation of updated software programmes in their business place. Zoho mostly keep their focus on the customers and their requirements from the organization. The leadership and the management team of this organization also focus on their employees and the culture of thier workplace, which influences them to maintain a healthy working environment throughout their workplace of Zoho.
In the contemporary software business industry , Zoho has become one of the most successful organization for its working strategy.Zoho made a plan to minimize to the adoptionof its operating infrastructure for business purpose . They work on scalability by combining their CX platforms vertically and horizontally so that more organization can be more attached to their customers (Zoho, 2022).In Zoho , the business procedure is B2B, which means Business-to-Business is populated in the workplace . However consumers of this organization can customize tools of Zoho CRM. Zoho always pride itself on its business procedure for being easier to utilise yet stronger enough to meet the requirements of even most demanding business operations.
# Current IT set-up of the organziation
This organziation work as a cloud-based service. Businesses who want to connect with Zoho, sign up and get started utilizing Zoho without any long- term agreements or upfront costs. The traditional IT set-up of this organization is created based on some usual software and hardware materials , which are date centres, facilities , networking hardware desktop computers , servers of the organization and also enterprise application software solutions.
The company conducts its business service operations with the support of complete toolkit that is identified as "The full stack ITSM platform".This platform supports and delivers flawless service with standardized workflow , and intelligent automation and expands the self-service abilities of this organization. It is simple and secure IT management from cloud which helps to ensure 360-degree security and endpoint managementof the IT networj of the usiness that uses Zoho services (Zoho, 2022). It motorized patch management in the SaaS way. Zoho smoothly keeps tabs on misplaces pathces of the connected network, motorized patch management and secure the endpoints (macOS,Windows and Linuz) of the distributed workforce over the cloud to monitor a variety of peration metrics relevant to servers, websites, applications, networks and actual user experiences by utilizing this compact monitoring tool in its infrastructure.
# Recommendations
# The contrast between non-cloud and cloud solutions for every characterstic of the infastructure.
In a non-cloud environment of Zoho , resources are basically deployed within the IT infrastructure of the company. The organziation itself is responsible to maintain the solution and all relevant procedures of the IT infrastructure of the company. Where there are various forms of cloud computing in a public cloud computing environment , all the resources are provided on the sites of this service provider but Zoho becomes able to evaluate the resources and utilize them as mucg aas they want at any specific time.
On the other hand , as this company is related to software service providing , hence it needs a standard level of security that a cloud strategy can provide. Security concers are one of the barricades to a cloud computing deployment. (Bello et al,2021). In the personal data of employees , such as login details of them, security threats are existent, hence for overcoming the problem from the infrastructure of the workplace. Zoho should move ahead with same cloud strategy in thier IT infrastrcutre.
# Appropriate deployment type and service level for each characterstic and justification for it.
In the deployment of the IT infrastructure of Zoho, the service level of cloud strategy should be implemented in the infrastructure of the enterprise. Public cloud computing such as in a private cloud or in a  hybrid cloud, resources are provided on the sites if the service provider and the enterprises are also able to focus on those resources , which updgrade the business procedure in the workplace of Zoho.
To maintain proper security in the IT infrastructure of the company, Zoho should use the cloud tsrategy in its workplace. Zoho is related to software service providing business procedures, whcih needs extra privacy in its infrastructure . Cloud computing is always more secur than non-cloud computing (Mohammad and Bazi, 2022). Most of the cloud providers have more resources to keep information secure than each business does , whcih should be implemented by the Zoho workers in theri infrastructure updated and repair the vulnerabilities quickly.
Again for maintaining compliance in the IT infrastrcutre , Zoho should use the service level of cloud strategy for ensuring that theri third party provider remains updated to the required codes. To ensure the privacy of the users, Zoho must implement the idea of cloud strategy to get a updated infrastsrcutre in their premises.
Downtime is one of the main disadvantages of cloud computing in IT infrastructure , as when internet access will run out , the user cannot do anything with the cloud . Therefore, in this case , Zoho should be recommended to use non-cloud computing rather than cloud solutions to maintain a proper working time in the IT department.
# Conclusion
The above study was related to the cloud strategy and its sample deployment in the IT infrastructre of a company, named Zoho. The first part of the study has elaborated the overview of this organization and then the current IT setup of this company. The last part of the study has recommended required cloud and non-cloud solutions to make up a better infrastructure in the IT premises of Zoho.
